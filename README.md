## Express JS is used to make server for game,web,app development

# To make a NODE JS project steps we have to follow--
<ol>
<h2>Setup Node JS project--</h2>
<li>On Terminal/Command Prompt: npm init -y (To make a package.json file)</li>
<li>create an index.js file where package.json file is there</li>
<li>In package.json file there in scripts section add <i>"start":"node index.js"</i></li>
<li>To run the project, write on terminal: npm start / npm run start (any of them)</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<h2>Setup Express Application--</h2>
<li>On Terminal: npm install express/ npm i express (To get node_modules directory where all third party code is there)</li>
<li>In package.json file, write the version of node js, "engines":{"node":"19.9.0"} (By doing this later we can get to know using which version of node we made this project)</li>
</ol>
